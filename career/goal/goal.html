							<h2>Why?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>I am sure it will be totally different between working as an employee and working as a leader. 
								<br>Because when I was in the army, I had to think and act different as a private and as a sergeant.
								<br>I realized how important to make my team understood a mission and most of all I tried to make ONE team who can sacrifice themselves for others.
								<br>I want to make a team with full of FUN people who have ownership mindset.
